# Spotify Integration for RuneLite
A not-so-simple plugin that shows you what music you're listening to in an overlay,
mutes the game audio when something is playing, and supports more than just Spotify.

# Bugs
Probably many. I literally don't know how to code in Java, nor do I have experience with RuneLite plugins, lol. Feel free to file a GitHub issue
if you're having trouble (and have double checked that it's not user error, ***please***).
